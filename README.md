# Overview

I am very glad to have the opportunity to learn new programming languages. As a software engineer my goal is to learn all that I can, and apply these teachings
to new and fun projects. I am trying to learn the basics of a new programming language every two weeks, this is a true challenge because I am choosing programming languages I am not familiar with. This is a great learning experience and I believe this will make me a better software engineer. 

This project was made using Kotlin, a modern object-oriented programming language. No third parties were used for this project, I only used the standard kotlin library. 
I used classes and objects to organize the game structure. I used immutable variables for my word list and mutable variables for user input. The purpose of the Hangman Game is
for the player to guess a hidden word, the player only has a limited amount of guesses to guess the word. As the player picks letters, I used lists and sets to store the possible words and to 
keep track of correct and incorrect guesses. Like in all programs, I defined functions to organize the logical steps of the game. I used loops to keep the game running. Finally, I used 
conditionals to check the logic of the game and to see if the player wins or loses the game.

My purpose for writing this software is to study and learn the basics of Kotlin. I also wanted to create a fun game. Hangman is a game I like to play using a notebook. Now I can play this game
in my computer. I also want to practice with the modern Kotlin programming language. The skills and abilities I learned during this project will help me develop better software in the future. 

Used to run the code: 
kotlinc *.kt -include-runtime -d HangmanGame.jar
java -jar HangmanGame.jar

# Development Environment

I used Kotlin to develop this Hangman Game, Visual Studio is my code editor. The game is compiled using kotlinc and I used the Java runtime (java -jar).
I used my computer terminal to test the game. I tried using Gradle, but it was too much of a mess, so I decided to run the game manually, this works well for small projects. 

I used Kotlin to develop this Hangman Game. Kotlin is an object-oriented programming language. It is a modern statically typed programming language. It was developed by JetBrains.
Kotlin runs on Java Virtual Machine, it can interoperate with existing Java code. I used the standard kotlin library, this library supports string manipulation, input/output, random selection,
colections and methods which I used to create this game. No third party libraries were used. I used kotlin's built-in features to create the game (classes, functions, loops, conditionals and collections).

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- Item 1 I would like to add difficulty levels
- Item 2 I would like to add a timer to make the game more intense
- Item 3 I would like to add multiplayer mode
- Item 4 I would like to add a hint system
- Item 5 I would like to add an art drawing of the hangman, but I think this option is difficult
